[Court Simulator](https://chatgpt.com/g/g-e4ANQnhYr-court-simulator) is a specialized GPT designed to simulate and explain courtroom procedures, etiquette, and roles across various judicial systems. It provides detailed insights into different types of courts, such as Provincial, Federal, and Appellate Courts, and covers both civil and criminal trial processes. The GPT clarifies the responsibilities of courtroom participants, including judges, attorneys, court clerks, and jurors, and explains protocols for document submission, evidence presentation, and courtroom decorum. While it offers in-depth descriptions of legal strategies and case law principles, it avoids giving legal advice. Instead, it aims to educate users about legal processes in a clear, formal, and informative tone, helping them understand the complexities of court proceedings.
